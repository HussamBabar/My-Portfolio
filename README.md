# My-Portfolio
I am a front-end developer focused on creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. My work is centered on turning ideas into functional designs using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks. I enjoy building projects that are not only visually appealing but also optimized for performance and accessibility.
